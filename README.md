# TSF-Task1
This project predicts student scores based on study hours using simple linear regression. The dataset is visualized and split into training and testing sets. A linear regression model is trained on the data, and predictions are made. The model is evaluated, and the predicted score for studying 9.25 hours/day is calculated and visualized.
